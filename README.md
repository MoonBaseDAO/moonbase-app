It's as easy as 1-2-3 & Done.

1) To create a local production environment, 
first download it to your machine and enter into the file directory::

```
git clone https://github.com/moonbasedao/moonbase-app.git && cd moonbase-app
```

2) After opening the folder in your command line or IDE, open a terminal and type:

```
yarn install && yarn build
```

3) After installation finishes, initiate a production build with:
